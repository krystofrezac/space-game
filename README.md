# Space game
[:eyes: Check it out here](http://space-game.krystof-rezac.cz/)

It's small game that I created as part of my school project. I tried to do it as much realistic as I could, so there is no air friction, no gravity and bullet speed is relative to rocket speed.

## Installation
Just run `yarn install` in root folder.

## Start game in dev mode
Run `yarn dev` in `game` and `api` folder.

## Start game in production mode
1. Run `yarn build` in `game`.
2. Run `yarn prod:start` in `api`.
3. Open `index.html` id `game/dist`.
